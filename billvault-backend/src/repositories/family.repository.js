 * @description Family Vault data access: insert vault, find vault by id/user, insert/update/delete membership, find vault bills, check member role
 *
 * Repository layer rules:
 *  - The ONLY layer that interacts with PostgreSQL
 *  - Uses the pg.Pool singleton from config/database.js
 *  - Contains parameterized SQL queries ONLY (never string-interpolated)
 *  - Returns plain JavaScript objects (not class instances)
 *  - Never contains business logic
 *  - Never calls external APIs
 *  - Never calls other repositories
 *
 * Replacing pg with Prisma or Drizzle requires changes ONLY in this file.
